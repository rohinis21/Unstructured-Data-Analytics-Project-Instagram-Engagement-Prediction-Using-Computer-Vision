    "### Objective\n",
    "Scrape approximately 500 posts from Pure New Zealand's Instagram page (@purenewzealand) to collect:\n",
    "1. **Image URLs** - Direct links to post images\n",
    "2. **Post Captions** - Text descriptions accompanying each post\n",
    "3. **Number of Likes** - Engagement metric for each post\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "We use **Selenium WebDriver** to automate browser interactions and extract data directly from Instagram's web interface. This approach:\n",
    "- Mimics human browsing behavior to avoid detection\n",
    "- Handles dynamic content loading through scrolling\n",
    "- Extracts data by clicking into individual posts\n",
    "- Filters out video posts (focusing only on image content)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **VPN Protection**: Prompts user to confirm VPN connection before scraping (we used Express VPN)\n",
    "- **Anti-Detection**: Disables automation flags and uses random delays\n",
    "- **Video Filtering**: Automatically skips video posts to focus on images\n",
    "- **Robust Extraction**: Multiple fallback methods for likes and caption extraction\n",
    "- **Data Persistence**: Saves results in both CSV and JSON formats\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "**Rate Limiting**: Instagram aggressively blocks scrapers. We implement:\n",
    "- Long delays between actions (30-60 seconds)\n",
    "- Random wait times to simulate human behavior\n",
    "- VPN usage to avoid IP blocking\n",
    "- Burner account to protect main account\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ethical Considerations**: This scraping is for educational purposes only and respects Instagram's public content.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why TF-IDF Vectorizer?**\n",
    "We used TF-IDF to give more weight to distinctive words and reduce the influence of generic ones. This improves logistic regression by normalizing text length and emphasizing unique, meaningful terms (e.g., \"fjord\" > \"travel\"). For captions and image labels, it helps the model focus on words that actually differentiate high- and low-engagement posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Indices Were Used**\n",
    "We created a single train/test split using index positions and reused those indices for all models. This kept the same posts in train/test across image-only, caption-only, and combined models—ensuring fair comparison and avoiding data leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Images and Captions Were Combined**\n",
    "We built separate TF-IDF vectorizers for image labels and captions to keep their vocabularies and scaling independent, then horizontally stacked the two feature sets before training. This let the model learn how much each modality (visual tags vs. text captions) contributes to engagement without one overpowering the other.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key Findings & Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Combined Model Achieves Best Performance (78.2%)**\n",
    "- The multimodal approach outperforms single-modality models\n",
    "- **7.3 percentage point improvement** over image-only model\n",
    "- **9.1 percentage point improvement** over caption-only model\n",
    "- Visual and textual features provide complementary information\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Image Labels Strong Solo Predictor (70.9%)**\n",
    "- Computer vision features alone achieve solid accuracy\n",
    "- Confirms Instagram's visual-first nature\n",
    "- Distinctive visual elements (landscapes, activities) drive engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Captions Slightly Underperform Images (69.1%)**\n",
    "- Text descriptions have predictive value but less than images\n",
    "- May indicate users engage with visuals before reading captions\n",
    "- Caption content may be more formulaic across posts\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Synergy Between Modalities**\n",
    "- Combined model doesn't just add features—it achieves synergy\n",
    "- The 78.2% accuracy suggests visual and textual cues work together\n",
    "- Some engagement patterns require both visual content AND context from captions\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I can conclude that using computer vision to predict whether a post will be above or below the median number of likes in the dataset is a better predictor than using captions alone, or even captions combined with text labels. Overall, **the combined model (image labels + captions) provided the best results at 78.2% accuracy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, this makes sense since, being Instagram, what carries the most weight is the image or picture uploaded. In addition, captions might not resonate as much with people or may not even be seen. It's the nature of the app. Hence, to predict and make recommendations, focus on your picture first, but don't ignore captions—the combination of strong visual content with contextual text descriptions achieves the highest engagement prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The data-driven insight**: What people **see** matters most, but what they **read** adds valuable context. The optimal strategy combines both.\n",

    "APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to uncover hidden thematic \n",
    "patterns in image labels and understand how different content themes relate to \n",
    "engagement (likes).\n",
    "\n",
    "ITERATIVE TOPIC SELECTION PROCESS:\n",
    "We initially started with 5 topics as a baseline, which is a common starting point \n",
    "for exploratory topic modeling. However, after examining the word distributions, we \n",
    "observed several challenges:\n",
    "    - Some topics had overlapping keywords (e.g., \"sky\" and \"water\" appearing in \n",
    "      multiple topics)\n",
    "    - Certain topics were too broad, mixing distinct visual themes together\n",
    "    - A few topics lacked clear interpretability, making it difficult to assign \n",
    "      meaningful labels\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve topic coherence and interpretability, we incrementally increased the \n",
    "number of topics. After testing 6, 7, and 8 topics, we found that 8 topics provided:\n",
    "    ✓ Clear thematic separation with minimal keyword overlap\n",
    "    ✓ Coherent word distributions that could be easily interpreted\n",
    "    ✓ Better coverage of the diverse range of photographic content in our dataset\n",
    "    ✓ Meaningful topic labels based on top words in each distribution\n",

    "\n",
    "The data clearly shows that **scenic and landscape-driven imagery**—particularly *Mountains & Adventure* (+0.25) and *Ocean & Coastal Landforms* (+0.12)—receives far higher engagement than posts focused on people, leisure, or transportation.\n",

    "Conversely, content focused on *Leisure & Vacation* (-0.15) and *Transportation & Mobility* (-0.08) significantly underperforms, suggesting audiences want to see destinations, not logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that **audiences are drawn to the beauty of New Zealand itself, not to depictions of tourists experiencing it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, what primarily excites viewers is *the place itself*, rather than depictions of visitors experiencing it. When the brand showcases vast, untouched scenery, engagement spikes. When it posts content centered on tourists relaxing, commuting, or posing, interest drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lead with scenery, not tourists.**\n",
    "   * Focus on awe-inspiring visuals of mountains, coasts, and natural landmarks.\n",
    "   * Use humans only as small, complementary figures to give scale or emotion — not as the main subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Sell the destination, not the trip.**\n",
    "   * Avoid over-representing travel logistics, vehicles, or \"tourist moments.\"\n",
    "   * Instead, frame experiences through the *landscape's perspective* — what travelers will see and feel, not what they look like doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use \"tourist content\" strategically.**\n",
    "   * When showing people, highlight authentic explorers or locals immersed in nature (hikers, surfers, climbers), not generic leisure poses.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintain visual consistency with the brand promise.**\n",
    "   * \"Pure New Zealand\" resonates most when posts emphasize natural purity, wilderness, and freedom of space — that's what converts browsers into tourists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In essence:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Posts that *show* New Zealand inspire travel; posts that *show people in* New Zealand don't. Keep the lens on the landscape, and the audience will keep their eyes — and travel plans — on you."
